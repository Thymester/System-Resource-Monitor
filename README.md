# System Resource Monitor

## Summary

The System Resource Monitor is a Python application built using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. It provides real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage on a computer system. The application allows users to set thresholds for CPU and memory usage, and it sends notifications when these thresholds are exceeded. Additionally, users can export the monitored data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features

- **Resource Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of CPU and memory usage in real-time.
- **Threshold Setting:** Users can set custom thresholds for CPU and memory usage. Notifications are sent upon threshold breaches.
- **Graphical Representation:** Monitored data is graphically presented in a line chart, showing CPU and memory usage over time.
- **Export Data:** Option to export monitored data to a CSV file for external analysis or record-keeping.
- **System Information Display:** Provides basic system information such as the number of CPU cores, total system RAM, and OS platform.

## How to Use

1. **Threshold Setting:** Enter desired CPU and memory thresholds.
2. **Start Monitoring:** Click "Start Monitoring" to begin monitoring.
3. **Stop Monitoring:** Click "Stop Monitoring" to pause monitoring.
4. **Export Data:** Click "Export Data" to save monitored data to a CSV file.
